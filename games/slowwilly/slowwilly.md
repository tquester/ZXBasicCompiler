## Original

## Changes
* The STOP statement has been added in line 9998 followed by the save statement
* Since the compiled version runs about 10-20 times faster some pause needed to be added
* The first PAUSE is in line 100 the main game loop
* A second pause has been added in line 205, otherwise it would be impossible to see willy walk

## Compiling
361 fine BASIC lines have been compiled into 3096 lines of assembler

Slow Manic Will compiles in integer mode without any compiler instructions
